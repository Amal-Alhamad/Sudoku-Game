## Design Patterns Implemented  

To ensure a structured and maintainable codebase, we applied the following design patterns:  

### 1. **Singleton (Creational Pattern)**  
   - Manages a single instance of essential game components to maintain consistency and prevent redundancy.  

### 2. **Facade (Structural Pattern)**  
   - Provides a simplified interface to interact with the game's core functionality, reducing complexity.  

### 3. **State (Behavioral Pattern)**  
   - Controls different game states (e.g., in-progress, paused, completed) to manage transitions smoothly.  

## Technologies & Tools  
- **Java** – Core programming language  
- **NetBeans** – Development environment  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Used to structure the game efficiently
